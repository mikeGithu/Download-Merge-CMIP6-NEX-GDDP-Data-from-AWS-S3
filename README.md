Download & Merge CMIP6 NEX-GDDP Data from AWS S3
This script provides an automated workflow for downloading and preparing CMIP6 NEX-GDDP climate data from NASA’s public AWS S3 bucket. After importing the necessary libraries—os for file handling, xarray for working with NetCDF files, s3fs for accessing Amazon S3, and netCDF4 for NetCDF support—the script begins by defining the configuration needed for the download process. This includes specifying the climate model, scenario, experiment, variable of interest, and the year range to extract. It also creates a local directory to store the downloaded files if it does not already exist. The script then connects anonymously to the public S3 bucket, which requires no AWS credentials, and lists all available files for the chosen model and variable. From this list, it filters out only those files that match the desired year range. Each selected file is then downloaded to the local machine, skipping any that already exist to avoid redundant downloads. Once all relevant files are available locally, the script uses xarray to open each NetCDF file and merge them into a single, continuous dataset along the time dimension. The resulting merged dataset represents the full climate time series—in this case, precipitation data from 1983 to 2014—for the specified model and scenario, ready for further analysis or export.
